 There might be various instances in our daily life where we want to copy the text from a pdf or an image, detecting these things was a huge task before. But now many OCR libraries has made the work easier.
 In this particular project I have done the text detection from the pdf as well as an image using the library ocrmypdf for pdf reading and easyocr for reading an image.
 Refer the .ipynb file in the repo for the code of project.
